3. Document your work in this `README.md` file.

## Reference frontend
If you want to use the reference frontend to see if your implementation of the
backend is working correctly, follow the below steps
1. `cd reference-frontend` to enter the directory.
2. `yarn install` to download all the dependencies.
3. `yarn start` to start the server.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see if the website is working correctly.
Feel free to make changes to the reference frontend as necessary. If you want
to work on the reference frontend as a supplementary challenge, the current
implementation does that utilize _tags_ (in the club view or while submitting
new clubs). Modifying the reference frontend to list club tags while browsing
clubs or allow users to include tags while creating a new club could be a good
place to start with improving the frontend.

## Submitting
Follow the instructions on the Technical Challenge page for submission.

## Installing Additional Packages
Use any tools you think are relevant to the challenge! To install additional packages 
run `pipenv install <package_name>` within the directory. Make sure to document your additions.
